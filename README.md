# SDS_assignement
## Environmental predictors of bird species richness across the United States: a route-based spatial analysis with a hexagonal grid comparison

This is a code for the final assignement of Spatial Data Science for Social Geography course (see: https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/).

A route-based analysis of bird species richness across the contiguous United States, using BBS routes as the observational units and environmental predictors summarized along each route.


### Research objectives

Quantify spatial variation in bird species richness across the contiguous United States using BBS routes.

Assess how NDVI and elevation predict species richness at the route level.

Evaluate spatial autocorrelation in species richness and model residuals.

Explore how spatial aggregation (hexagonal grid) alters richness patterns in a regional case study (e.g. California).
